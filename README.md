# easy-databases
 Easy-to-use pure Python databases that match basic data structures, including lists, sets, and dictionaries. No fancy querying language required. Supports sorted variants, large variants, Python objects, JSON objects, and more. Unlike normal collections, data is persistent. However, unlike ACID databases, locks on concurrency are up to the user to handle.
